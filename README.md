## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

One key thing I learned was how to better plan, structure, and design a card component using semantic HTML and reusable CSS classes. I also developed a stronger understanding of how to position elements precisely as intended by leveraging Flexbox. This project taught me the importance of structured planning in producing clean, maintainable code and ensuring accessibility across different devices and screen sizes.
